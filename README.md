### Dude,

- Let's be clear and simple.
- Think before you type something.
- Programming is like writing something.
- You majored in English Lang and Lit! Don't forget that!

### Alright then... What is a good program?

- Correct. No errors.
- Easy to understand.
- Easy to modify and extend.
- Good performance and speed.

### How can I make a good program?

- Don't make mistakes.
- Design Pseudocode.
- Test your design.
- Always fix warnings.

### This is my commit message convention

- `feat` : new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
- `fix` : bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
- `docs` : changes to the documentation
- `style` : formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change
